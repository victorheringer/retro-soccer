# Retro Soccer

A Game Boy game based on classic soccer manager games like Elifoot II for ZX Spectrum.
It uses [gbdk 2020](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020) distribution for Linux builds.

> WARNING! This is a long term, experimental project for self learn

# Setup

Running the `make.sh` file with all requirements to run gbdk should do
the job, it creates the ROM file (main.gb) that can be tested using any emulator (I like [SameBoy](https://sameboy.github.io/) it has versions for both Windows, Mac and Linux with cool features for debugging).

```
make
```
